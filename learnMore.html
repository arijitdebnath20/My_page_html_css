	<h2 class="lm2"> Our Visionary :</h2>
<div style="white-space: pre-wrap;" class="lm3">           India is home to 20 percent of world's visually impared persons. In the world the estimation is arround 284 million which is itself a shocking number. statistics suggest among this section only 10% people have access to education, which reflects the facts and myths about the educational reforms of visually impared. Our visionary holds a strong potential of being commertialised as it bridges the communication gap and let technology lightens the darkness of visually impared. </div>
<h2 class="lm4"> Our Objective :</h2>
<div  class="lm5" ;style="white-space: pre;">           Preparation of a digital keyboard for visually impared persons which will support them using electronic gadgets i.e. smart phones. </div>
<div class="lm6"> Visually Impared persons have day to day problem and basic one of them is typing in this text savvy world. The kaypad phones have the embedded Braille keyboard but our modern smart phones are lack of that. So we are aiming to build a smart typing Braille embedded board by which they will be able to type in any electronic gadget like smartphones, computers. </div>
 <div class="lm7">So let us understand the technicality behind the project. Our project is based on piezo electric sensors. We will arrange the peizo sensors in a Braille fashion and by tracing the values of the piezo which generates the output voltage. This is how we can monitor the value and determine the character. This is how they will be able to type digitally.</div>
 <h2 class="lm8"> Basic Idea : </h2>
 <div class="lm9"> We will be using 6 piezo sensors pasted in a 4*4 inch box with an Arduino in it. When the piezo sensors are pressed a voltage difference of about 10mV to 100mV is obtained. And by caliberating the input voltage with the threshold value in the arduino we can get the desired output. This arduino can be connected to a smart phone or computer and desired output can be seen in the sreen. Most advantageously the whole setup is very light weight and compact, so it can be carried easilly</div>
